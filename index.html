                    <center> CAVE2</center>
Advantages:
One of the most notable aspects about the CAVE was how large and impressive the screens were. The immersive feel of being surrounded by brightly lit displays was something that other VR apparatuses cannot compare to. The resolution on the screens is not something found on other virtual reality devices, and so the experience is much more elegant. Additionally, being able to use only glasses with the screen was nice, as it provided a lightweight, fairly non-intrusive way to experience virtual reality without the necessity of wearing bulky, heavy gear. In addition, having surround sound capabilities also added to the immersive feel and set a mood that was unlike any of the other VR devices that I used.
Disadvantages:
The disadvantages of the cave has to be cost and portability. It is easy to infer that the CAVE equipment must have cost MUCH more than any of the other devices, especially with the fact that there are 18 computers working with 72 monitors, adding on the cost of the infrared cameras along with the glasses that had the infrared sensors on them. In terms of portability, the CAVE2 also lacked. There is absolutely no way to efficiently move the CAVE2 around, since there is so much equipment involved.
                    <center> HOLOLENS</center>
Advantages:
The hololens was nice because having an Augmented Reality device allowed you to still be in the present moment and see all of the surroundings around you, but still be able to see the objects that were being displayed on the screen. For the alien game that we played, I think this resulted in a much more adrenaline-inducing effect, since the scary aliens were in the room with you, making it a fun experience. Additionally, in comparison to the Vive, it was wireless which was nice, because moving around didn’t require you to stay in one spot.
Disadvantages:
The disadvantages I saw with the hololens was that it was very bulky in comparison to the head gear required to wear in the CAVE2. Additionally, because it was Augmented Reality, I believe that being in the original setting may have detracted a little bit from a fully immersive feel of using the VIVE or being in CAVE2. In addition, the quality of the touches and gestures was not always great, resulting in a lot of missed clicks.
                        <center>VIVE</center>
Advantages: 
The advantages of the VIVE were that I felt as though I was really there. Because of the full headset and it being full VR, I was completely immersed in the game, to the point where I actually dropped my keys and phone because I was so involved with the game itself. Additionally, having something to click on was nice because it gave me some tactile feedback which I believe helped me do well throughout the game. 
Disadvantages
Similar to the Hololens, the headset was very bulky and hard to adjust to at the beginning. Additionally, having to specifically do clicks took away from some of the “wow” factor of it being VR. In addition to that, having to be wired in seemed almost dangerous, as some of the games required a lot of moving around, making it plausible for someone to accidentally unplug themselves or trip or have some other kind of accident. Also, because it wasn’t as good of a resolution as with the CAVE, it wasn’t quite as impressive as it could have been.
